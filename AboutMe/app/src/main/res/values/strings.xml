    <string name="bio_text_text">Hi my name is Paul. \n\n I am 27 and I am software engineer. \n\n For a long time, I never thought I would find something that I love doing. Seeking a challenge, I chose to study Computer Science. I am so grateful after 3 years of studying computer science to be able to say that I love developing applications and using code to solve problems.\n Throughout my studies, I gained many important skills such as perseverance, problem-solving, time management and teamwork. I also picked up many different technical skills and programming languages along the way. \n With the guidance of one of my professors, I am working to create a complex schema for an API where developers can make requests to a server. The server queries a database and sends back data that I provided to the database. I have worked on a few different websites and built an ecommerce application on the side as well. There are so many projects I would like to tackle, from using multiple raspberry pi\'s to construct my own web server to building an application that will detect nefarious emails and texts using artificial intelligence.  My goal is to become the best version of myself. Intellectually, spiritually, and physically, I try to be better everyday. It is not about the results, it is about the process. Love the journey</string>
