# KotlinAndroidTutorials

## 21 Day Kotlin Khallenge 
I am challenging myself to a 21 day Kotlin Khallenge where in Kotlin making Android apps for 21 days straight. I will be posting about my progress here. 

## Day 1 
I spent my time coding in Kotlin today going over basic coding techniques that I am familiar with from java. Some of the concepts I refreshed myself on were multi-threaded 
programming, comparable, file read and write, and singleton design pattern.

## Day 2 (Find My Age app)
I wanted to start off easy. This is an application where a user can enter the year they were born and tap on the find age button and the application will display the age. 
Some technologies I refreshed myself on was textview, edittext, constraint layout, and accessing UI with kotlin.
